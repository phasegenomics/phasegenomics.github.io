1   Credentials
---------------------
When Phase has completed a project, you will recieve notification via email. In the data delivery email, there will be a username and IP address for an sftp server with your data. In a separate email you will recieve a pem key file to access the sftp.

Your data will be available on the sftp for two weeks (14) days from the date of the email. If you anticipate needing more time to finish backing up your data, please reply directly to the delivery email.

2   Sftp Solutions
---------------------
### GUI
If you do not already have a preferred tool, we recommend [CyberDuck](https://cyberduck.io/sftp/). It has a free tier and is simple to install and use. 

### CL
Alternatively, you can use the command line. To connect to the server: `sftp username@IP`. Then enter the password (copy and pasted from the pem file) when prompted.


If you have difficulty accesing your data, please [let us know](mailto:support@phasegenomics.com).
