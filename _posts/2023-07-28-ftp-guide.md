1   Credentials
---------------------
When Phase has completed a project, you will recieve notification via email. There will be a username and sftp server address in the email. In a separate email you will recieve a pem key file to access the sftp.

They will look like this 
username: `phase_user_00@gmail.com`   
server address: `s-xxxxx.server.transfer.us-west-2.amazonaws.com`   

Your data will be available on the sftp for two weeks (14 days) from the date of the email. If you anticipate needing more time to finish backing up your data, please reply directly to the delivery email.

2   Sftp Solutions

### User Interface
If you do not already have a preferred tool, we recommend [CyberDuck](https://cyberduck.io/sftp/). It has a free tier and is simple to install and use. 

### Command Line
Alternatively, you can use the command line. To connect to the server:  
`sftp -i {pem file} phase_user_00@gmail.com@s-xxxxx.server.transfer.us-west-2.amazonaws.com`
